        <h2>About</h2>
        <p><b>Anne Lister</b> (3 April 1791 â€“ 22 September 1840) was an English landowner and diarist from Halifax, West Yorkshire. Throughout her life, she kept diaries that chronicled the details of her daily life.<br> Her diaries contain more than 4 million words, and about a sixth of them were written in code. <br><br></p>

        <h2>Translation Tool</h2>
        <p>I used scans of Anne Lister's diary from here to create a font which resembles her handwriting. The key for her crypthand can be seen here and here. The text entered is translated appropriately to Anne Lister's crypthand, but note that special characters, numbers, and punctuation will not be included in the translation, as they are not included in her code. I do show spaces between the words for ease of understanding, but Anne did not include and spaces in her crypthand.
